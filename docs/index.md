## My work-flow helpers

### cpu-profile

**[cpu-profile](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/raw/actual-scripts/cpu-profile)** is a script that tweaks your system to make it consume less power :zap:. It relies on `powertop` and `cpufreqctl` to set a [CPU scaling governor](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling#Scaling_governors), a maximum frequency for your cores and the number of cores you want to use. If arguments are not passed to the script, it will prompt you to insert them. Your battery will be grateful :battery:.

### crypt

**[crypt](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/raw/actual-scripts/crypt)** is a small utility, wrapper for `openssl`, that you can use to encrypt :lock: and decrypt :key: your files.

### tinyurl

**[tinyurl](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/raw/actual-scripts/tinyurl)** is a small script that makes your URL :link: shorter by using [Tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com)’s API.

### gitio

**[gitio](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/raw/actual-scripts/gitio)** is a small script that makes your Github URL :octocat: :link: shorter by using Github’s [git.io](https://git.io) service.

### optimize-boot

**[optimize-boot](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/blob/actual-scripts/optimize-boot)** is a simple utility that increases boot time :hourglass_flowing_sand:. It is not completed yet, but I’m working on it. In the gif below there are the benefits for my system.

### pdf-compress

**[pdf-compress](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/blob/actual-scripts/pdf-compress)** is a simple Ghost-script wrapper to compress a PDF off-line. Works pretty fine :sunglasses: :page_facing_up:. 

### wallpaper-download

### getnews

**[getnews](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/raw/actual-scripts/getnews)** calls [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) :newspaper: with my encrypted :key: and stored in the `keys` folder. It prints out a formatted set of news (default Italian ones). 

### ghclone

**[ghclone](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/raw/actual-scripts/ghclone)** is a script that, provided a Github :octocat: user name, prints out all the repositories from that user and asks you which repository to clone. (you can choose between ssh and http).

### lyrics
