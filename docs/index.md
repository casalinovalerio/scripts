## My work-flow helpers

### cpu-profile.sh

**[cpu-profile.sh](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/raw/actual-scripts/cpu-profile.sh)** is a script that tweaks your system to make it consume less power. It relies on `powertop` and `cpufreqctl` to set a [CPU scaling governor](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling#Scaling_governors), a maximum frequency for your cores and the number of cores you want to use. If arguments are not passed to the script, it will prompt you to insert them.

### crypt.sh

**[crypr.sh](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/raw/actual-scripts/crypt.sh)** is a small utility, wrapper for `openssl`, that you can use to encrypt and decrypt your files.

**[tinyurl.sh](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/raw/actual-scripts/tinyurl.sh)** is a small script that makes your URLs shorter by using [Tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com)’s API.

### round-image-cropper.sh

**[round-image-cropper.sh](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/blob/actual-scripts/round-image-cropper.sh)** is pretty self explanatory…

### optimize-boot.sh

**[optimize-boot.sh](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/scripts/blob/actual-scripts/optimize-boot.sh)** is a simple utility that increases boot time. It is not completed yet, but I’m working on it. In the gif below there are the benefits for my system.
